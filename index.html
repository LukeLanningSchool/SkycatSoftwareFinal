				<h2 style="color: #cfadad;">About Skycat Software</h2>
				<p>Skycat Software is an indie software development team that develop software as a hobby. Projects currently being developed by the team include: video games, computer applications, AI programs, and this website.</p>
				<p>Skycat Software was officially founded in 2023 when the team, consisting of three developers, broke off from Starlight Software.</p>
				<p>Prior to breaking off, the group (who would eventually form Skycat Software) started working on individual projects, however the only project that was completed and released before separation was Droplets, an arcade-style video game.</p>

				<h2>Sneak Peeks</h2>
				<p>Here is some projects we are currently messing around with:<br />(We do not guarantee that any of these projects will ever be released or finished; this section just gives an idea about our current whereabouts)</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Fling Sword:</b> A <i>Getting Over It</i> style PvP game where you use a sword to fling yourself at enemies.</li>
					<li><b>Alien Stowaway Reloaded:</b> A remake of our previous Alien Stowaway game that is hopefully simpler and easier to play and understand. Coming soon (within a year probably) to Rec Room.</li>
